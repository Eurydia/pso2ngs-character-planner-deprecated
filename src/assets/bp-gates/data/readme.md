# Region rule

Originally, the quests only takes place in one region, which make it is more straight-forward when deciding which region to put on a content.

However, with the introduction of "Drill: A Trap in the Forest", now an piece of content can span multiple reigon.  
To prevent confusion, just put the region as the "region that the content is introduce".

In the case of "A Trap in the Forest", it came out in Kvaris, so its region would be Kvaris as well.
